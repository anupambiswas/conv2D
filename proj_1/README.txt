For proj_1, you can generate different regions. On different runs of the code, it will create different 2D domains.

Instructions to build and run the code:

$ make
$ ./run
# This will create a region with 100 boundary line segments

$ ./run 20
# This will make a region with 20 boundary line segments

In order to clear all files created due to a single run of the code, use the following command.

$ make resetf
