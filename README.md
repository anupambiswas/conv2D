This project is based on dividing any singly connected 2D domain into internal polygonal zones all of which have their internal angles less than 180 degrees. Currently it has two projects included. This code may be used for generating points either inside or outside a complex two dimensional domain, which again has applications in mesh generation techniques.

The codes have been written in C++. The algorithm can be easily extended for multiply connected 2D regions.
